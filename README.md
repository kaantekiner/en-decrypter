# Readme
It is a low-level data encrypter which work by c#, just uses a basic char list to cover or uncover your data input. Its important that script just made for fun and educational purposes. But if you still want to use it in real life situations, sure you can, truely its better than forward your data in plain text, but it may act unwanted if your data contains char which is not contained by scripts char list, check it first. Thanks.
 

### Prerequisites

Visual Stuio, Mono, MonoDevelop, .Net Core or some c# compiler or IDE like theese will be enough.

## Usage

You can just run the script with terminal, or you can copy-paste it into a IDE like VS and run it from there. After that just follow the instructions on command prompt.

## Development and Features

The scripts on github which belongs to me is just for fun and to help novices that they can understand how-to. May be, i can work on and upgrade this script when i have some free time. If i can, features will be added i think is;

```

- utf-8 support, for all characters
- stronger encryption
- solve bugs of long input crash
- performance upgrade for real use
- more complicated, may be encoded source code

```
